This blog is a place for some of the interesting things I have made or done. I started it in 2011 as a place to document my first arduino project, then I pretty much forgot about it. Months later I realized that people were still viewing and making use of the information in that post, so I decided to pick it back up and include more of my projects. Unfortunately this website will only be updated sporadically as I always seem to have less spare time than I need.
