This blog is simply a place to record some of the interesting (at least I think so) things I have made or done. I started it in 2011 as a place to document my first arduino project, then I pretty much forgot about it. Months later I realized that people were still viewing and utilizing the information posted here, and I decided to pick it back up and include more of my projects. Unfortunately this website will presumably only be updated sporadically as life often has a way of intervening at just the moment one finds a good use of their spare time.
