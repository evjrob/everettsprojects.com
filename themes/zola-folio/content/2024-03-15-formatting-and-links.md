This is a post showing off the formatting power of markdown. You can easily add links, such as this one to a [great static site generator](https://getzola.org). You can also create lists super easily. No more HTML ```<ul>``` and ```<li>``` tags!

#### My list
* one
* two
* three
* four
 
Quotes in markdown are simple too! Add one like this:

> If I waited for perfection, I would never write a word.
>
> â€” Margaret Atwood
