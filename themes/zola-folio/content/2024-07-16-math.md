This theme also provides MathJax support via the extra.math parameter. When enabled, the MathJax javascript library is included via CDN, and a latex formula such as

```
$$
\frac{df}{dx} = x^2 + y
$$
```

Will be rendered like so:

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = x^2 + y
$$

You can also embed math into a paragraph with single \\$ as delimeters. For example, inlcuding "\\$y = f(x)\\$" will render as $y = f(x)$.
