This blog is mostly just a place for me to keep track of some interesting projects I have worked on. It started as a Wordpress site in 2011 to document my first arduino project. I shared that project on Reddit and then forgot about it for months before noticing how popular the post had become. That little bit of interest inspired me to work on and share more projects. Now I repeat the process of intermittently sharing things and forgetting about them on a months or years long cycle. Glad you found your way here, and hope you enjoy or learn something from my eclectic collection of projects.
